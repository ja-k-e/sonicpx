              This is the Image player. In order to use it, you'll need a Sonic Pixels image.
              You can generate one either by <a href="#mic">recording your microphone</a>
                or <a href="#file">converting an Audio&nbsp;file</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have your image, drop it in the file area.
              It will load the image, then you can hit play (▶) and hear what the image sounds
                like.
              To play it again, you have to re-add the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Be warned, random images will not sound good and might get a little loud.

              Sonic Pixels stores a sample of 16 bit audio inside of a single pixel. It has the
              capacity to store 24 bits, but for the time being, translates everything as 16.
              That means your variable bit rate mp3 or 24bit WAV will not sound exactly the same.
              However, your 16 bit WAV will.

              I am having trouble getting the browser to behave with more than 30 seconds of
                source audio.
              I have successfully recorded a full 4-minute song, but can't manage to do it with
                much consistency. That is why there are limits.

              Here you can record an Audio message as an image!
              Hit record, give the app access to your microphone then speak a message.
              You can stop whenever you like, or it will stop for you after 30 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the audio is complete, right click the generated image and "Save Image as..."
                to save it to your computer.
              As long as the image remains in the exact same format you saved it in,
                it should be playable in full quality at <a href="#player">sonicpx.com#player</a>.
